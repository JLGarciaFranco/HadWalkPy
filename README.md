This is a repository for code to compute the divergent and non-divergent wind components using available horizontal U and V wind components. 
The main features of the code are:
  1. Computation of the irrotational and non-divergent components of the wind (Helmholtz decomposition)
  2. Local Hadley-Walker circulation characterized by streamfunction and vertical velocities. 

The code is built into a single class under the file:
